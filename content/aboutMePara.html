I have been practicing computer programming professionally for about 3 years. I prefer to call something better than others after playing it with myself. That's the reason I don't hesitate in trying different technologies. So far, I have written code in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12177761" target="_blank" >World's most popular languages and platforms</a>  including PHP, JS, Java, .Net, etc. This not just gave me an added skill, but helped to learn the design philosophies followed by the innovators and gurus of the industry. In the recent past, I have developed a habit of reading about innovation, technology, etc. (By following one, actually two of my best mentors and colleagues) that help me to analyze the future trends. Have a look at resume to know which technologies inspired me enough to take them as my career.
