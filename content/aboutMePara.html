I have been practicing computer programming professionaly for about 3 years. I prefere to call something better than others after playing it with myself. Thats the reason I don't hesitate in trying different technologies. So far, I have wriiten code in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12177761" target="_blank" >World's most popular languages and plateforms</a> including php, JS, java, .Net etc. This not just gave me an added skill but helped to learn the desing philossopies followed by the innovators and gurus of the industry. In recent past, I have developed a habit of reading about innovation, technology etc (By following one, actually two of my best mentors and colleagues) that helps me to analyze the future trends. Have a look at resume to know which technologies inspired me enough to take them as my career.
